# Hugo Theme

We're using the Ananke theme. In a real implementation, you would either:

1. Add the theme as a Git submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
   ```

2. Or download and extract the theme manually to this directory.

For this demonstration, the theme directory structure is represented by this placeholder.
